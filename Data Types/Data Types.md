## JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
String  
Number  
Bigint  
Boolean  
Undefined  
Null  
Symbol  
Object  

## The Object Datatype
The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects.

Built-in object types can be:  
objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.

## JavaScript Types are Dynamic
This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.

## JavaScript Numbers
All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals

**Note**  
Javascript numbers are always one type:  
double (64-bit floating point).

## Exponential Notation
```javascript
let y = 123e5;    // 12300000
let z = 123e-5;   // 0.00123
```

## BigInt
JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

## Undefined
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
